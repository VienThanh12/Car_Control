It will basically control the car by using the joystick (Servo).

I will have NPN transistor, 1k resistor, LED, push putton, Dc motor and a joystick.
Whenever we push the pushbutton, it will activate the motor to go forward. 
I use NPN transis. It will have 3 legs. The first one will be the base. It will connect with the LED and then the 1k Resistor and push button also and the last one will be 3k3 VCC. 
The second will be C and the the third will be E
NPN -> C - E
C will go with the (-) DC motor
E will go with the ground
(+) will go with the 3.3 VCC
The map it will be like this one

3.3 VCC -> (+) MOTOR -> (-) MOTOR -> C -> E -> Ground

I control the servo by using a joystick.
It will have the vertical and x so that it will know how to operate.
